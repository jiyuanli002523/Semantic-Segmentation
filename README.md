# Sematic-Segmentation Study



## About this project



This git is my study on Semantic Segmentation tasks with TensorFlow and Keras 



The template is forked from [TensorFlow Project Template](https://github.com/MrGemy95/Tensorflow-Project-Template)



## Release



* [Version 1.0](https://github.com/kuro10/Sematic-Segmentation/tree/d123e2f3b198361eca069ca902a50d53ed52e987) : The first version of this project is well done for training a FCN-Alexnet model with Kitty Road Dataset. However, it is quite difficult to restore this model for a prediction. So these constraints will be optimized in the following update.
